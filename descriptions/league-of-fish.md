A game about eating stuff. First you are in the water eating yellow stuff, then you get legs and eating other bug-things. There's also a multiplayer, where you eat yellow stuff to get legs and then eat the other player.

The last game I made in Game Maker. It is not a good game, but I am impressed that I got the multiplayer made within the 48 hours.

Made for Ludum Dare 24, which had the theme 'Evolution'.
