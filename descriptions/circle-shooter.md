Shoot circles, avoid circles, be better than your circles, uh, friends!

Fight against the circles as the rebellious triangle, while avoiding the devious counterattacks!

Not really.
Circle Shooter is a simple arcade game, where you try to shoot a red circle in the middle of the screen, with a green triangle that moves in a circle and constantly shoots, while avoiding other circles. That's a lot of circles, avoiding and shooting.

Inspired by Extra Credits' series on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z06QR-tz1_o](making your first game), I've made an arcade shooter, where you move in circle,around a circle, shooting circles, while avoiding circles, but you yourself is a triangle.

Made because I hadn't made a game for over a year.
