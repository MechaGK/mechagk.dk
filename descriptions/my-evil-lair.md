A game based on the idea of a reverse platformer. Trigger obstacles like falling floors and spikes to kill the heroes (white squares). You also have a floor mounted gun in some levels!

The game is not that exciting and the way it works is kinda weird, though it is probably my most unique game. This game is what game jams are for, games that aren't that great but has some idea that wouldn't normally get released.

Made for Ludum Dare 25, which had the theme 'You are the Villain'.
