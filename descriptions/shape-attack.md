Shoot shapes to take their position and shape.

A fine mechanic, but this game executes it poorly. While the mechanic would work best in a puzzle game, the game is more score based random thing, which doesn't really work. Luckily I did make a puzzle, which does show a greater potential.

Made for Ludum Dare 26, which had the theme 'Minimalism'.
